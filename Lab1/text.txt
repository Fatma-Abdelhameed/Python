 In the above example, we have imported the counter subclass from the collections module. Then we have created the empty counter. Then we passed the string of two words into the counter function “sample string” and printed the counter the counter function’s output. You can see that the counter function has given the count of each and every character in the string and the number of times that character is repeating. Then we have passed the list of the words into the counter function. The list contains three words; now, if we print the counter function result this time, we will get each word’s count. Then we have the character and assigned some number to it inside the counter function. Now we are trying to print the elements of the counter function using the sorted function. The sorted function will sort the list elements. Now you can see that the counter function has printed the character as many times as the number we have assigned to it. The counter function will not execute any integer equal to zero or less than zero.
